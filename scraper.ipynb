And this is how we got here, because there are a lot of things that we could have prepared for that we didn't, because we were so concentrated on where we were.\"</p>, <p>This chaotic approach has characterized healthcare IT for decades. In a sector where lives depend on technology working flawlessly 24/7/365, security teams have traditionally functioned as gatekeepers—the \"Department of No\"—focused on protection at the expense of innovation and care delivery.</p>, <p>But as healthcare continues its digital transformation journey, this approach is no longer sustainable. With 14 hospitals, hundreds of urgent care clinics, and nearly 30,000 employees serving millions of patients, MultiCare needed a different path forward – one that didn't sacrifice innovation for safety. That shift began with a mindset change at the top that was driven by years of experience navigating these exact tensions.</p>, <p>After 15+ years as a healthcare CISO, Elrod has a unique perspective on the security challenges facing healthcare organizations. According to him, healthcare's specific operational realities create security dilemmas unlike any other industry:</p>, <p>It's a recipe for burnout, blame, and breakdowns. But what if security could enable care instead of obstructing it?</p>, <p>Watch how MultiCare turned that possibility into practice in the Elisity Microsegmentation Platform case study with Jason Elrod, CISO, MultiCare Health System.</p>, <p>The breakthrough for MultiCare came with the implementation of identity-based<a href=\"https://elisity.co/3Z4qyVe\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> microsegmentation</a> through Elisity.</p>, <p>\"The biggest attack surface is the identity of every individual,\" notes Elrod. \"Why are the attacks always on identity? Because in healthcare, we must make sure all the information is available when they need it, with the minimum amount of friction possible.\"</p>, <p>Traditional network segmentation approaches relied on complex VLANs, firewalls, and endpoint agents. The result? \"A Byzantine spaghetti mess\" that became increasingly difficult to manage and update.</p>, <p>Elisity's approach changed this paradigm by focusing on identity rather than network location:</p>, <p>When Elrod first introduced Elisity to his team, they responded with healthy skepticism. \"They're like, 'Did you hit your head? Are you sure you read what you were saying? I thought you stopped drinking,'\" Elrod recalls.</p>, <p>The technical teams were doubtful that such a microsegmentation solution could work with their existing infrastructure. \"They said, 'That doesn't sound like something that can be done,'\" shares Elrod.</p>, <p>But seeing was believing. \"When you see people who are deeply technical, people who just know their craft really well, and they see something and go 'Wow'… it shakes the pillars of their opinions about what can be done,\" explains Elrod.</p>, <p>The Elisity solution delivered on its promises:</p>, <p>...all without forcing a tradeoff between protection and performance.</p>, <p>But what surprised Elrod most wasn't just what the technology did, but how it changed the people using it.[JE2] </p>, <p>Perhaps the most unexpected benefit was how the solution transformed relationships between teams.</p>, <p>\"There's been a friction point. Put this control and constraint around the network. Who's the first person to call? They're going to call IT. 'I can't do this thing.' And I'm saying, 'Well, you can't open everything, because everybody can't have everything. Because the bad guys will have everything then,'\" Elrod explains.</p>, <p>Identity-based microsegmentation changed this dynamic:</p>, <p>\"It changed from 'How do I get around you?' and 'How do you get around me?' to cooperation. Because now it's like, 'Oh, well, let's make that change together.' It shifted culturally, and this was not something I expected… We really are on the same team. This is a solution that works for all of us, makes all of our jobs better, Security and IT. It is a force multiplier across the organization,\" says Elrod.</p>, <p>With Elisity, security and IT teams now share incentives rather than competing priorities. \"The same thing that allows me to make connectivity work between this area and here in a frictionless fashion is also the same exact thing that provides the rationalized security around it. Same tool, same dashboard, same team,\" Elrod notes.</p>, <p>For healthcare providers, the impact is profound. \"If they don't have to worry about access, don't have to worry about the controls, they can take the cognitive load of thinking and worrying about the compliance factors of it, the security, the privacy, the technology underlying the table that they're working on,\" says Elrod.</p>, <p>This shift enables a fundamental change in how security interacts with clinical staff:</p>, <p>The traditional separation between security and IT operations teams is rapidly becoming obsolete as organizations recognize the strategic advantages of integration. Recent research demonstrates compelling business benefits for enterprises that successfully bridge this divide, particularly for those in manufacturing, industrial, and healthcare sectors.</p>, <p>According to Skybox Security (2025), 76% of organizations believe miscommunication between network and security teams has negatively impacted their security posture. This disconnect creates tangible security risks and operational inefficiencies. Conversely, organizations with unified security and IT operations reported 30% fewer significant security incidents compared to those with siloed teams.</p>, <p>For healthcare organizations, the stakes are even higher. Among healthcare institutions that experienced ransomware attacks, those with siloed security and IT operations reported a 28% increase in patient mortality rates in 2024, up from 23% in 2023 (Ponemon Institute &amp; Proofpoint, 2024). This stark reality underscores that cybersecurity integration isn't just an operational consideration—it's a patient safety imperative.</p>, <p>The financial case for integration is equally compelling. A Forrester Total Economic Impact study on ServiceNow Security Operations solutions demonstrated a 238% ROI and $6.2 million in present value benefits, with a 6-month payback period when integrating security and IT operations (Forrester/ServiceNow, 2024).</p>, <p>Forward-thinking organizations are adopting sophisticated integration models like Cyber Fusion Centers. Gartner research confirms these represent a significant advancement over traditional security operations, predicting that by 2028, 20% of large enterprises will shift to cyber-fraud fusion teams to combat internal and external adversaries, up from less than 5% in 2023.</p>, <p>For enterprise leaders, the message is clear: breaking down operational silos between security and IT teams isn't just good practice—it's essential for comprehensive protection, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage in today's threat landscape. Few understand that better than Elrod, who's spent decades trying to bridge this gap both technologically and culturally.</p>, <p>For Elrod, identity-based microsegmentation represents more than just a technology solution—it's a bridge between where healthcare has been and where it needs to go.</p>, <p>\"Technology in the past wasn't bought because it was crappy… They were great. Good intention. They did what they needed to do at the time. But there's a lot of temporal distance between now and when that made sense,\" he explains.</p>, <p>Elisity helps MultiCare \"build that bridge from where we have been to where we need to go… It's a ladder out of the pit. This is great. Let's stop throwing things in there. Let's actually do things in a rational fashion,\" says Elrod.</p>, <p>While no single solution can address all of healthcare's security challenges, identity-based microsegmentation is \"one of the bricks on the yellow brick road to making healthcare security and technology the culture of Yes,\" according to Elrod.</p>, <p>As healthcare organizations continue to balance security requirements with the need for frictionless care delivery, solutions that align these competing priorities will become increasingly essential.</p>, <p>By implementing identity-based microsegmentation, MultiCare has transformed security from a barrier to an enabler of modern healthcare—proving that with the right approach, it's possible to create a culture where \"yes\" is the default response without compromising security or compliance.</p>, <p>Ready to escape your own security \"mosh pit\" and build a bridge to modern healthcare?

One of the pages in question had about 18,300 followers.</p>, <p>The threat actors behind the activity leveraged fake accounts to manage Facebook Pages, direct users to off-platform websites, and share comments on posts by politicians and news entities. The accounts masqueraded as locals living in Romania and posted content related to sports, travel, or local news.</p>, <p>While a majority of these comments did not receive any engagement from authentic audiences, Meta said these fictitious personas also had a corresponding presence on other platforms in an attempt to make them look credible.</p>, <p>\"This campaign showed consistent operational security (OpSec) to conceal its origin and coordination, including by relying on proxy IP infrastructure,\" the company noted. \"The people behind this effort posted primarily in Romanian about news and current events, including elections in Romania.\"</p>, <p>A second influence network disrupted by Meta originated from Iran and targeted Azeri-speaking audiences in Azerbaijan and Turkey across its platforms, X, and YouTube.

It's suspected that the website is promoted via search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to artificially boost its rankings in online search engines. </p>, <p>Users who end up on the website are urged to download the product by claiming to offer free access to the tool for the first year, with a monthly subscription of $95 thereafter. What gets actually downloaded is a ZIP archive containing a .NET executable (\"NovaLeadsAI.exe\") that was compiled on February 2, 2025, the same day the bogus domain was created. The binary, for its part, acts as a loader to deploy the PowerShell-based CyberLock ransomware.</p>, <p>The ransomware is equipped to escalate privileges and re-execute itself with administrative permissions, if not already, and encrypts files located in the partitions \"C:\\,\" \"D:\\,\" and \"E:\\\" that match a certain set of extensions. It then drops a ransom note demanding that a $50,000 payment be made in Monero into two wallets within three days.</p>, <p>In an interesting twist, the threat actor goes on to claim in the ransom note that the payments will be allocated to support women and children in Palestine, Ukraine, Africa, Asia, and other regions where \"injustices are a daily reality.\"</p>, <p>\"We ask you to consider that this amount is small in comparison to the innocent lives that are being lost, especially children who pay the ultimate price,\" the note states. \"Unfortunately, we have concluded that many are not willing to act voluntarily to help, which makes this the only possible solution.\"</p>, <p>The last step involves the threat actor employing the living-off-the-land binary (LoLBin) \"<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/cipher-exe-security-tool-for-the-encrypting-file-system-56c85edd-85cf-ac07-f2f7-ca2d35dab7e4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cipher.exe</a>\" with the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cipher\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"/w\" option</a> to remove available unused disk space on the entire volume in order to hinder the forensic recovery of deleted files.</p>, <p>Talos said it also observed a threat actor distributing the Lucky_Gh0$t ransomware under the guise of a fake installer for a premium version of ChatGPT.</p>, <p>\"The malicious SFX installer included a folder that contained the Lucky_Gh0$t ransomware executable with the filename 'dwn.exe,' which imitates the legitimate Microsoft executable 'dwm.exe,'\" Raghuprasad said. \"The folder also contained legitimate Microsoft open-source AI tools that are available on their GitHub repository for developers and data scientists working with AI, particularly within the Azure ecosystem.\"</p>, <p>Should the victim run the malicious SFX installer file, the SFX script executes the ransomware payload.

When the installer is launched, the batch file is run through the Windows shell in an infinite loop, which, in turn, executes Numero and then temporarily halts it for 60 seconds by running the VB script via cscript.</p>, <p>\"After resuming the execution, the batch file terminates the Numero malware process and restarts its execution,\" Talos said. \"By implementing the infinite loop in the batch file, the Numero malware is continuously run on the victim machine.\"</p>, <p>A 32-bit Windows executable written in C++, Numero checks for the presence of malware analysis tools and debuggers among running processes, and proceeds to overwrite the desktop window's title, buttons, and contents with the numeric string \"1234567890.\" It was compiled on January 24, 2025.</p>, <p>The disclosure comes as Google-owned Mandiant revealed details of a malvertising campaign that utilizes <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/labs/ai-meets-next-gen-info-stealers-in-social-media-malvertising-campaigns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">malicious ads</a> on Facebook and LinkedIn to redirect users to fake websites impersonating legitimate AI video generator tools like Luma AI, Canva Dream Lab, and Kling AI, among others.</p>, <p>The activity, which was also recently exposed by <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fake-ai-tools-used-to-spread.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Morphisec</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fake-kling-ai-facebook-ads-deliver-rat.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check Point</a> earlier this month, has been attributed to a threat cluster the tech giant tracks as UNC6032, which is assessed to have a Vietnam nexus.

It affects all versions of the plugin below and including 2.9.2 released on November 29, 2024. There is currently no patch available.</p>, <p>The website security company said the issue lies in a function named \"tinvwl_upload_file_wc_fields_factory,\" which, in turn, uses another native WordPress function \"<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_handle_upload/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wp_handle_upload</a>\" to perform the validation, but sets the override parameters \"test_form\" and \"test_type\" to \"false.\"</p>, <p>The \"test_type\" override is used to check whether the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) type of the file is as expected, while \"test_form\" is to check to verify if the $_POST['action'] parameter is as expected.</p>, <p>In setting \"test_type\" to false, it allows the file type validation to be effectively bypassed, thereby allowing any file type to be uploaded.</p>, <p>That having said, the vulnerable function is accessible via tinvwl_meta_wc_fields_factory or tinvwl_cart_meta_wc_fields_factory, which are only available when the WC Fields Factory plugin is active. </p>, <p>This also means that successful exploitation is only possible if the WC Fields Factory plugin is installed and activated on the WordPress site and the integration is enabled on the TI WooCommerce Wishlist plugin.</p>, <p>In a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor could upload a malicious PHP file and achieve remote code execution (RCE) by directly accessing the uploaded file.</p>, <p>Plugin developers are recommended to remove or avoid setting 'test_type' =&gt; false when using wp_handle_upload().
